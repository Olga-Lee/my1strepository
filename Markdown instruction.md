## Text highlighting

To highlight the text in italic, needed to frame it up with asterikses ( * ) or low marking sign ( _ ). For example, *like this*  or _like this._

To make text semi-bold, needed to frame it up with double asterikses ( ** ) or double low marking sign ( __ ). For example, **like this** or __like this.__ 

Alternative text highlighting ways, bold or italic, give an opportunity to combine this both ways together. For example: _text can be in italic and along with thihs can be **semi-bold** as well._
