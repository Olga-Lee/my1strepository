# Markdown manual

## Text highlighting

To highlight the text in italic, needed to frame it up with asterikses ( * ) or low marking sign ( _ ). For example, *like this*  or _like this._

To make text semi-bold, needed to frame it up with double asterikses ( ** ) or double low marking sign ( __ ). For example, **like this** or __like this.__ 

Alternative text highlighting ways, bold or italic, give an opportunity to combine this both ways together. For example: _text can be in italic and along with thihs can be **semi-bold** as well._

## Lists 

To highlight unordered list, mark  point with asteriks ( * ) or + mark. 
To add an unordered list, you need to mark points with the asteriks ( * ). For example, like this:
* Element 1
* Element 2
* Element 3
+ Element 4


To add an numbered list, you need to put numbers for points. For example, like this:
1. Element 1
2. Element 2
3. Element 3



## Working with images

![Hello, this is LuxHire!] (logo LH.jpg).

## Links

## Working with remore repository
A remote repository in GitHub is a cloud-hosted version of your project that you can link to your local repository, enabling collaboration and backup; you work with it using commands like git push to upload changes, git pull to fetch updates, and git clone to create local copies.

## Pull request
A pull request in GitHub is a way to propose and collaborate on changes to a codebase. It allows developers to submit changes from one branch (often in their forked repository) into another branch (usually the main branch) of a repository. The repository maintainers can review, discuss, and approve the changes before merging them.

## Conclusions

### *GitHub is an excellent platform for beginners to collaborate on projects, track code changes, and learn version control with Git, making teamwork and project organization seamless. Its user-friendly interface and vast community resources help new users quickly build technical skills and participate in open-source contributions.*
