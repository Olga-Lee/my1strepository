# Markdown manual

## Text highlighting

To highlight the text in italic, needed to frame it up with asterikses ( * ) or low marking sign ( _ ). For example, *like this*  or _like this._

To make text semi-bold, needed to frame it up with double asterikses ( ** ) or double low marking sign ( __ ). For example, **like this** or __like this.__ 

Alternative text highlighting ways, bold or italic, give an opportunity to combine this both ways together. For example: _text can be in italic and along with thihs can be **semi-bold** as well._

## Lists 

To highlight unordered list, mark  point with asteriks ( * ) or + mark. 
To add an unordered list, you need to mark points with the asteriks ( * ). For example, like this:
* Element 1
* Element 2
* Element 3
+ Element 4


To add an numbered list, you need to put numbers for points. For example, like this:
1. Element 1
2. Element 2
3. Element 3

## Working with tables 

Tables in Markdown are created using pipes (|) and dashes (-). Each row is separated by a line break, and columns are defined by the pipes. Example:
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1A   | Row 1B   | Row 1C   |
| Row 2A   | Row 2B   | Row 2C   |
* You can align text in columns using colons (:) in the separator row.

| Left-Aligned | Center-Aligned | Right-Aligned |
|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|
| Text 1       | Text 2         | Text 3        |
| More Text    | Centered       | Aligned Right |
